      "This book aims to break down each character into its constituent elements and then build up a learner’s knowledge of the history and the deeper meanings of these characters over the course of each chapter. Presenting fundamental knowledge of Chinese characters according to their intrinsic regularity rather than in the sequence often used in teaching spoken Chinese.<br/>You will improve your understanding of how and why the language came to evolve to the current state it is now.",

      "The next book on our list is the only reference you will ever need for Chinese grammar. This book covers every single rule, quirk and pattern that you will find over the course of learning Chinese. This grammar is broken down into easy-to-parse chapters whereby a learner can rapidly find an answer to the constant question: <em>But why is it written like this?</em><br/>Adding value to this reference book is its very detailed index, which allows the book to function as a grammar dictionary. Readers can look up certain rules, flip to the page they’re on, and understand how they’re used.",

      "While the other books deal directly with learning, this one is entertaining as well. As a simplified version of the Chinese classic, it’s a great entry point for those interested in reading their first novel. Despite the fact that the grammar and vocabulary have been simplified, the overall plot of a young man struggling with an arranged marriage in 1930s China is nonetheless engaging and funny.<br/>This book also functions as a way to boost vocab and comprehension. Alongside the body text of this book, each chapter is followed by a list of new uncommon vocabulary. In addition, each chapter has its own quiz based on the content of the book, and a learner can easily test themselves to make sure that they really did understand the content.",

    subtitle: "The real Chinese you were never taught in school",
    description:
      "One part of Chinese that’s very rarely taught either online or in classic textbooks is Chinese slang. Like any language, Chinese contains a huge slang vocabulary that’s often overlooked in teaching due to vulgarity, grammatical incorrectness or simply because the author doesn’t know it. Nonetheless, it’s very important to learn and understand the most common of these slang words.<br/>What’s more, the book is written in a very light-hearted tone and is accompanied with many humorous illustrations, so learning from this book can often be a very funny experience.",

    description:
      "I could not finish the list without this book. While not really about Chinese learning, it presents a complete methodology to learn new languages in the most effective way possible.<br/>Starting with pronunciation, you’ll learn how to rewire your ears and turn foreign sounds into familiar sounds. You'll retrain your tongue to produce those sounds accurately, using tricks from opera singers and actors. Next, you'll begin to tackle words, and connect sounds and spellings to imagery, rather than translations, which will enable you to think in a foreign language.  And with the help of sophisticated spaced-repetition techniques, soon you'll be able to learn grammar and memorize hundreds of difficult and abstract words.",
